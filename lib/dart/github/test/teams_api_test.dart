For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  To add someone to a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer in the team they're changing.

If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.
