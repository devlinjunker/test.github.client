    // Compare two commits
    //
    // Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`.  The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.  The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.  **Working with large comparisons**  The response will include a comparison of up to 250 commits. If you are working with a larger commit range, you can use the [List commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits) to enumerate all commits in the range.  For comparisons with extremely large diffs, you may receive an error response indicating that the diff took too long to generate. You can typically resolve this error by using a smaller commit range.  **Signature verification object**  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:  | Value                    | Description                                                                                                                       | | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | `expired_key`            | The key that made the signature is expired.                                                                                       | | `not_signing_key`        | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature.                                           | | `gpgverify_error`        | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service.                                                         | | `gpgverify_unavailable`  | The signature verification service is currently unavailable.                                                                      | | `unsigned`               | The object does not include a signature.                                                                                          | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit.                                                                                      | | `no_user`                | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit.                                                          | | `unverified_email`       | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. | | `bad_email`              | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature.             | | `unknown_key`            | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account.                                                  | | `malformed_signature`    | There was an error parsing the signature.                                                                                         | | `invalid`                | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature.                      | | `valid`                  | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified.                                                  |

    // Create a deployment
    //
    // Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.  The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them before we merge a pull request.  The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.  The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds, the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will return a failure response.  By default, [commit statuses](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success` state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.  The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.  The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an application with debugging enabled.  Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.  #### Merged branch response You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating a deployment. This auto-merge happens when: *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example *   There are no merge conflicts  If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful response.  #### Merge conflict response This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.  #### Failed commit status checks This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success` status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

    // Create a repository dispatch event

    // You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see \"[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch).\"  The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow. For a test example, see the [input example](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#example-4).  To give you write access to the repository, you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope.

    // Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory in `:path`. If you omit `:path`, you will receive the contents of all files in the repository.  Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#custom-media-types) for retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#custom-media-types) to ensure the content is returned in a consistent object format.  **Note**: *   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/). *   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees API](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/#get-a-tree). *   This API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.  #### If the content is a directory The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \"type\" specified as \"file\". Logically, the value _should_ be \"submodule\". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \"submodule\".  #### If the content is a symlink  If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object  describing the symlink itself.  #### If the content is a submodule The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit.  If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\"git\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\"html\"]`) will have null values.

    // You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.  Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first completes.

    // Upload a release asset
    //
    // This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.  You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.  Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:   `application/zip`  GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.  When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.  **Notes:** *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The \"[List assets for a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-assets-for-a-release)\" endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact). *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.
